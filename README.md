This was my practice run for ICPC. There are more than 250 accepted solutions listed here. I have also added tags for some of the problems.

- At first try to come up with a solution by yourself. 
- If you can't then read some article on the associated tags and try again. 
- If you still can't then you proceed to the solution. Try to understand what is going on. Then try your own approach. 

The CSES problems can be found here: https://cses.fi/problemset/list/
This set has some classic problems.
