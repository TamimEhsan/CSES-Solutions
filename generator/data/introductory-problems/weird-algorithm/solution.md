# Solution

This problem asks us to implement the Collatz conjecture sequence, also known as the 3n+1 problem.

## Algorithm

The algorithm is straightforward:

1. Start with the given number n
2. Print n
3. While n is not equal to 1:
   - If n is even: n = n / 2
   - If n is odd: n = 3n + 1
   - Print n

## Implementation Details

- We need to handle the sequence step by step
- Print each number in the sequence separated by spaces
- The sequence always ends at 1 (this is the Collatz conjecture, though unproven, it holds for all tested values)

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) on average, though the exact complexity is unknown due to the unproven nature of the Collatz conjecture
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - we only need to store the current value

## Key Insights

1. **Simple Simulation**: This is a direct simulation problem - just follow the rules
2. **No Optimization Needed**: The constraints are small enough that a direct approach works
3. **Integer Operations**: Be careful with integer division (though not an issue in this problem)
4. **Termination**: The sequence always reaches 1 for the given constraints
